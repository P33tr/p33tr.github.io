That looks easy enough, there plenty of documentation and lots of people have done it before. Blindly follow the tutorial you found on the internet. It fails in a way not documented anywhere. Give up an look for another solution, or just give up.</p> <p>Recently I was at a loose end where I work. Current project had stalled. A colleague, senior consultant who had been given the task of setting up a software application so we could asses it called and suggested I take on the task. He also suggested that when I get to the docker install he would like to be involved so he could learn from it. A little strange I thought but hey ho, sure I said. (The implication here is that he had tried to do this install, failed and was passing the task to me, well thats my interpretation).</p> <p>Install some open source software on a server. Easy no?</p> <p>There is official documentation and a list of instructions for a windows install and a linux install and many others. In fact there is an overwhelming amount of documentation. Here I realize that this software is not so simple. A database is involved, its PHP, and laravel. The reason there is lots of documentation is exactly because its not easy.</p> <p>Also there is the docker option as previously mentioned.</p> <p>So off I trot to make a windows vm in azure. This doesn't work, lots of reasons, but the main one being the stability of the resulting server. Each time I create a virtual machine, something goes wrong, either and error message come up, or something doesn't work. Eventually I get a running windows vm, but starting the  process of installs I realize that running PHP on IIS looks like an unnatural nightmare. So I give up on this route.</p> <p>Lets go for the Linux option.</p> <p>I create a Linux vm and start installing all the bits. Following a u tube video of some other guy. What seems evident to him is not quite working for me. So he starts using docker-compose and I realize I don't have docker on this vm. Ok, divert into installing docker. Then I realize I don't have PHP, so I go down that road. Various things don't work and I end up just cutting and pasting things from the internet without understanding what I am doing. Basically I don't know what I am doing in Linux world and I have only got a command line interface to work with.</p> <p>Time for a break. Chill, consider this is the end of the line. Go for it again. After some though, I come to the conclusion that the reason the website is not running, might be because I wasn't in the 'home' directory when I installed a bunch of stuff.</p> <p>Start the whole process again on a fresh built vm. But this time putting code in a subdirectory of the home directory. Eventually I get some signs of success, or at least no failures. No big red errors. Manage to run a setup process, here there are questions I dont know the answer to, and no clue given as to what the implications of the answers are. Issues around root users and passwords, I dive off again to try to resolve the issues, isn't the internet wonderful. The setup process completes without errors. But the website url still gives 404. Hmm. Tempted to give up again. What do you do when everything appears to have run correctly, but the result just doesn't work?  Re-run the setup, it lets me do this happily, and shows that things have already been installed. Go back to basics. One question,  enter the url of the website, ok, so lets just put the ip address. Runs through the rest of the setup, and BINGO. Its working.</p> <p>It took all day, it took multiple fresh vm instances, I re-ran the setup process multiple times, in different places and with different answers. I even read the documentation. </p>"},{"location":"Posts/how-to-code-review/","title":"How to do a code review","text":"<p>A long long long time ago in a big corporate IT department sat a junior dev, just started. Ahhh, I remember my first code review well. Prior to my first code review, I had been working for 2 quite small companies where there were a maximum of 5 developers, and, even though I was inexperienced I was considered an expert in the areas I was working in. Nobody had ever formally reviewed my code. Now, I was just a tiny dev resource in a large travel company working in an IT department that covered the whole floor of a large office building. It also had one of those proper server rooms with grey boxes, disk drives the size of fridges and a fire system that I was told could kill you if you didnt exit the server room in under 10 seconds.</p> <p>The program was a report, with headings and sub headings and sub totals and all that and eventually it would be coded in VAX COBOL. But, I had been asked to write it in pseudo code on paper first. This was written on preprinted form which had sections such as ACTION: and EXPLANATION: . The theory was that anything could be expressed as either a loop (while), and if statement (when) or an assignment (assign). </p> <p>Once finished 4 copies of each page were made and popped into a distribution envelop for the reviewers, and a meeting was scheduled for several days time. The review was held n a meeting room on the third floor of the office building, my first time on the third floor. In the meeting sat my team leader and mentor, along with another programmer, a business analyst, and a senior dev from another team.</p> <p>They read each page and commented on its contents. One reviewer wanted the variable names to have some strange prefix convention, and then another complained that a loop counter name was too long. I dont remember the details now, but not a single page was left without a correction. After 30 minutes of grilling I left the room almost in tears. But I did learn something. How not to do a code review.</p> <p>Things have moved on. I never expect to have to do a code review of a handwritten program. Now its all Pull Requests and online comments.</p> <p>The aim of the code review is to maintain the quality of the code base to a certain standard, but also to mentor and educate the team. A code review should only stall the process if there is a serious fault that would introduce a bug. Everything else is just opinion and can be dealt with according to the priority at the time. Getting that element right is tricky. For example: A hot fix going into production does have to be code reviewed, and I welcome that, and require it. I am happy for another dev to take a look at my fix, confirm I am not doing anything stupid. But I do not want the dev to block the change just because I used an underscore in a variable name and thats not in the standards. The priority in this instance is to fix production with the least stress possible.</p> <p>If however, we are in the normal SDLC and a junior dev has submitted a change that ignores the code standards completely, then that is possibly a justifiable blocker on the PR.</p>"},{"location":"Posts/how-to-code-review/#use-the-moscow-model","title":"Use the MOSCOW model","text":"<p>Each comment should be prefixed with one of the following MUST:, SHOULD:, COULD:, or WOULD: And each comment should be accompanied by en explanation and if possible an effective solution.</p> <ul> <li>MUST: The code has to change before approval.
